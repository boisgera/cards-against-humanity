# Cards Against Humanity

## A party game for horrible people.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cards_Against_Humanity)

> [Cards Against Humanity](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/) 
> is an adult party game in which players complete fill-in-the-blank statements 
> using words or phrases typically deemed offensive, risqué or politically 
> incorrect printed on playing cards. 
> It has been compared to the 1999 card game Apples to Apples and originated 
> from a Kickstarter campaign in 2011. 
> Its title refers to the phrase "crimes against humanity", 
> reflecting its politically incorrect content. 

For example, one question is:

  - 🎓 I am sorry Professor, but I couldn't complete my homework because of ___________

and some possible answers are:

  - 👿 The Devil himself.

  - 🐙 A pangender octopus who roams the cosmos in search of love.

  - 👖 Extremely tight pants.

  - 🖤 Racially-biased SAT questions.

  - 🧠 A brain tumor.

  - 😓 Poor life choices.

  - 👨‍👧 Daddy issues.

  - 😷 COVID-19.

  - 🔥 Being on fire.


### The project

We **don't** want you to make an online version of the game; we very much
agree with the game authors when they say 

> We highly recommend not playing online and instead playing in the real world 
> so you can look your dad in the eye while saying "pixelated bukkake."[^0]

Instead we'd just like to use mobile phones (that are ubiquitous) to replace 
the physical deck of cards (that you probably don't carry around all the time)[^1].
But otherwise we'd like to keep as much as possible the spirit and dynamics 
of the original game.

[^0]: Here is the definition of [pixelated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixelation) 😉

[^1]: But by all means, buy the [classic deck of cards](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/products/cards-against-humanity) if you want to support Cards Against
Humanity financially and/or the [Science Pack](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/products/science-pack) whose profits are donated to the [Science Ambassador Scholarship](https://www.scienceambassadorscholarship.org/) for women in STEM.


### Technical stack

  - **Mobile Apps suckz, Web Apps rules.** You app will be hosted in a (mobile)
    browser which means the "usual" foundation: HTML, Javascript, CSS, etc.

  - **Peer-to-peer.** Since every player will use his own mobile phone as a 
    virtual hand of cards, these browser need to communicate. We'd like to
    avoid the need a central server

### FAQ

  - **Is Cards Against Humanity (the company) going to sue me ?**

  - **But I know only Python, not Javascript!**

  - **Why is this project in English and not in French?**
